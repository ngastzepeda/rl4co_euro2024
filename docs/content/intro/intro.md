# Introduction

RL4CO is an extensive Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) benchmark. Our goal is to provide a unified framework for RL-based CO algorithms, and to facilitate reproducible research in this field, decoupling the science from the engineering.




## Motivation

### Why NCO?
Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) is a subfield of AI that aims to solve combinatorial optimization problems using neural networks. NCO has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems, such as the routing problems in logistics, the scheduling problems in manufacturing, and electronic design automation. The key idea behind NCO is to learn a policy that maps the input data to the optimal solution, without the need for hand-crafted heuristics or domain-specific knowledge.


### Why RL?
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables agents to learn how to make decisions by interacting with an environment. RL has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems, such as playing games, controlling robots, and optimizing complex systems. The key idea behind RL is to learn a policy that maps the state of the environment to the optimal action, by maximizing a reward signal. Importantly, optimal solutions are not required for training, as RL agents learn from the feedback they receive from the environment.



## Contents

We explore in other pages the following components:

- [Environments](environments.md): Markov Decision Process (MDP) for CO problems and base classes for environments. These are based on [TorchRL](https://pytorch.org/rl/stable/index.html).

- [Policies](policies.md): the neural networks that are used to solve CO problems and their base classes. These are based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

- [RL Algorithms](rl.md): (broadly: "models"), which are the processes used to train the policies and their base classes. These are based on [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/).
