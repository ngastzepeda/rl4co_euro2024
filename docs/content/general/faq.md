### I ran into an error in the tutorials. What should I do?

We try our best to test the tutorials but some edge cases may not be covered. If you encounter an issue, firstly we recommend to try installing the bleeding edge version of the library from source, which may resolve the it. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -U git+https://github.com/ai4co/rl4co.git
```

If you still encounter an error, you may check out open issues on GitHub [here](https://github.com/ai4co/rl4co/issues) and in case open one. Remember to report versions of the library and the environment you are using with the following commands:

```bash
python -c 'from rl4co.utils import show_versions; show_versions()'
```
